# start-TSlog
Sometimes, users experience problems which dissapear before you can act. With this script, wireshark/Tshark runs continuously in the background. The user just has to run the script a 2nd time when the networking problem arises and it will take a copy of the continuous, rotational logs. Allowing you to observe past and present connectivity.

## Prerequisites
Powershell v5.0 for the archiving functionality and obviously wireshark (or well Tshark) installed on the user's computer.
Haven't tested this in a domain environment yet.
